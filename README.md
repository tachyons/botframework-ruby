  connector.app_id = ENV['MICROSOFT_APP_ID']
  connector.app_secret = ENV['MICROSOFT_APP_SECRET']
end

BotFramework::Bot.on :activity do |activity|
  # Activity.id , identifier of the activity
  # activity.timestamp

  # activity.from, sender 
  # activity.conversation
  # activity.topic_name

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
